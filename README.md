|  Title   | Venue (Rank)  | Method | Description | Link |
|  ----          | ----   | ----   |    ----| ----|
|Improving Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs Using Graph Summarization| ICONIP (A) | GraphLSTM | Using GraphLSTM and GCN to improve Question Answering on knowledge graphs and represent questions and entities/relations as low-dimension vectors | [link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-030-92273-3_40)|
| Learning Graph Representations with Recurrent Neural Network Autoencoders | KDD (A*) | GraphLSTM | Leveraged various methods to generate sequences from a graph structure and trained a GraphLSTM model to embed those graph sequences into a continuous vector space. | [link](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2018/files/deep-learning-day/DLDay18_paper_27.pdf)|
|Dynamic representation learning via recurrent graph neural networks | IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems (Q1)| GraphLSTM | Applied GraphLSTM and proposed a one-stage model called Dyn-GNN. The model embeds an RNN into a GNN model to produce a representation in a compact form.| [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9858109)|
